## Abstract:

Proportionality is a central and globally spread argumentation technique in public law. This repository contains a rule-based classifier that predicts whether proportionality is invoked or not. The classifier is tailored to the case law of the German Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC). Here we provide the python code including a brief explanation of how it works. Please see our publications for more information on our research on proportionality.

The repo contains two files: File <i>rule_based_classification.py</i> contains the code of the classifier with all the rules. The <i>example.ipynb</i> notebook shows how the classifier can be executed and also contains a brief explanation of how it works.
